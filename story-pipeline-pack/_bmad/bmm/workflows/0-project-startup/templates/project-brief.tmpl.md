## Goals

{ASK_USER: List of measurable project goals - EVERY goal MUST have a metric:}

1. **Goal 1:** {ASK_USER: goal description} - **Metric:** {ASK_USER: how is success measured}
2. **Goal 2:** {ASK_USER: goal description} - **Metric:** {ASK_USER: how is success measured}
3. **Goal 3:** {ASK_USER: goal description} - **Metric:** {ASK_USER: how is success measured}

## Target Users

{ASK_USER: Who are the target users? Describe at least 1 persona:}

### Persona 1: {ASK_USER: persona name}
- **Role:** {ASK_USER: specific role, NOT generic "user"}
- **Needs:** {ASK_USER: main needs}
- **Pain points:** {ASK_USER: current problems}
- **How the project helps:** {GENERATE_AND_VALIDATE: specific benefit derived from Vision + needs}
